  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
  <br>It is a language that is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.
  <br>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.[9]
  <br>JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications.
  <br>The vast majority of websites use it,[10] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
  <br>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles.
  <br>It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O,
  <br>such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.
  <br>Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software,
  <br>including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software,
  <br>and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.
  <br>The terms Vanilla JavaScript and Vanilla JS refer to JavaScript not extended by any frameworks or additional libraries. Scripts written in Vanilla JS are plain JavaScript code.[11][12]
  <br>Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
  <br>JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.[13]</p>
